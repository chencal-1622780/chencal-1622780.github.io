                        <p>
                            In order to approach this problem, we would have to define what our agenda is.

                        <p>We are here to help you drive product sales and inform users of the latest trends relating to food. Whether it be recipes, cookware, or ingredients, we intend to ultimately engage and excite users about the Foodie Fanatic brand.</p>

                        <h2>Problems that users are having</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our current problems that our existing that our users are having is that many users feel that the site is cumbersome and difficult to navigate. This often leads users to search
                            other resources for their needs. Also, the users are not aware of the breathe of offerings from Foodie Fanatic. Users do not realize that Foodie Fanatic has extensive recipes, instructional content presented
                            via multi-media and food related events and classes. Most importantly, users are confused about about the site contains.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Strategy and its social platform</h2>
                        <p>
                            For the purpose of this project, with business and content goals in mind. To remedy some of the issues above, I have put forth a series of principles when redesigning Foodie Fanatic. Our ease of access, espicially on mobile should be our top priority first because the majority of our users would use this application
                            on a mobile device, instead of desktop computers. Thus, having a mobile first approach would be ideal. The users stated that the site is confusing to look and and does not understand what it really contains. Therefore, a clarity
                            and relevance to what the user is looking for is another value that sohuld be focused on. A sense of community as well as social interaction between users should be encourages and promote the growth of this product and encourage the involvement and inclusion of all users with varying skills,
                            backgrounds, and experiences. Our online strategy is to develop a social media platform centered around food, allowing users to interact with a diverse group of foodies. This includes staying conected with their community by keeping up with the latest events, share personal content,
                            voicing their opinions, providing feedback to other foodies, and further establish their credentials within their community.

                        <p>
                            Given the problems that were discusses with the conflicts of the original website/mobile application, focusing and analyzing popular food websites like Williamson Sonoma is important because
                            of how successful their website is.

                            Decides to use card based interface because this design interface provide us with a simple layout for a mobile devide. It is intuitive to our user and their needs. We have based these categories on our sitemap
                            , where the taxonomy is reinforced for the goal of each card. By tapping each card, it directs users to each category. Also, a hamburgr menu is added for extended options and because it is so universale, it is easily recognizable
                            to most of our users.

                        Students that struggle or have questions with the content of said courses are only offered help through office hours, or CLUE sessions late at night. Here lies one problem with the current system, for some students, 
                        they are not able to attend said office hours or extra sessions for help.</p>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>
                        In order to solve our problem, we decided to create our product as an extension of Canvas. By doing this, we decrease the gap between the user’s goal and the means needed to execute said goal. Rather than create a completely separate app or website, which requires the user to go somewhere completely different, create or link an account and making separate login credentials;
                        AssignmentAider will be a part of Canvas so all the user will need to do is log in to Canvas to access our site. It is a means to have another facet for students to get additional help if they can not attend office hours or clue sessions. This solution gives students access to help that fits into the student's
                        schedule. Students are able to quickly direct themselves to the problem that they need additional assistance on, or a quick source of guidance on the material that they are currently learning in class. This will help pace students based on their desired progress because given our feedback from our survey questions, students feel either rushed, or slowed when attending clue and office
                        hours because of the limited time that they have or the amount of students attending the same event.

                            The data our group extracted shows the crime committed in Washington State.We used shiny app that displays multiple graphs of different types of data represented. The bar graph displays the type of crimes and the amount of crimes
                            committed for a specific individual county and year. The pie also does the same thing, but in a pie chart form. The scatter plot compares the average population to the total crimes, showing correlation, and the second scatter
                            plot displays the number of occurance of the crime the user chose in each county. The boxplot shows the overall statistics of the different crimes being committed in a given county. The map of the state shows the highest crime committed within a certain county.

                            Winter 2018 at the University of Washington. I created a visual infographic on the topic of Kobe Bryant. We used Tableau and other visual design tools such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Movie Maker.
                            Learned to solve design problems, give and receive critique, follow an iterative process of design refinement, and gained technical skills. Learned the fundamental nature of visual potential, 
                            visual design principles, and the impact of color and typography. I documented my models, design process, feedback, iterations,

                      <h2> FitBit - Memory Integration</h2>

                      <p>
                          The most prevalent existing solution to treat Alzheimer’s are consumable drugs. These drugs include cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine to treat the cognitive aspect of the disease. Although these drugs slow the progression of Alzheimer's, there are side effects to taking it.
                          Patients often experience nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and other health deteriorating effects. For example, cholinesterase helps with a person's ability to think clearly, but at the same time, it can degrade their neurotransmitters. Although memantine helps with memory and learning,
                          it also exposes cells to greater amounts of calcium, which can be damaging. Cholinesterase and memantine can be
                          improved by eliminating most of the side effects but this is not possible because if the chemicals inducing the side effects were removed, the drug won’t subdue Alzheimer’s anymore. Additionally, treating other parts of the brain with cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, and not solely
                          the cognitive part, would be another possible improvement. This is where we introduce an applcation, integrated with the fitBit app that 'prevents' people from inhibiting symptoms that will soon lead to Alzheimer's.
                      </p>
                      <br />

                      <h2>What group of people are you going to serve and what problem area are you going to investigate and address? </h2>
                      <p> We are going to serve an aging generation of “Baby Boomers” by investigating how we can revolutionize treatment for Alzheimer’s disease through the use of information technology. In particular, we will be looking to help patients by preserving their memories (and therefore their relationships) that they have
                       shared with people close to them, including their partners, friends, and family. This problem area should be addressed because living with a condition such as Alzheimer's severely impacts a person's functionality and their relationships with people that they truly care about.  Though from a conventional standpoint 
                       there is a large amount of funding, the people afflicted by Alzheimer's are underserved from a technology standpoint. 
                       Additionally, this creates a new profit opportunity for our group as this innovative product has the potential to become a very effective alternative to drugs. If we can integrate this product as a well established treatment, then we can fulfill an already established market need.

                      <br />

                      <h2>What existing solutions did you discover, what do they do well, and how can they be improved? </h2>
                      <p> There has been developments of virtual reality environments for people with Alzheimer's, allowing them to interact with things that they often could not. For example, a virtual reality environment, created by Opaque Multimedia, has been used to deliver sensory therapy to patients with Alzheimer’s. Called “The Forest Project,” the application achieves this by creating a hyper realistic forest environment that patients can experience and enjoy. Elements such as sunlight, butterflies, snow, and flowers are some examples of what the virtual environment can offer to evoke a sensory and emotional response from patients. In order to become an effective form of treatment against Alzheimer’s, sensory therapy through virtual reality has to trigger other senses as well,
                      such as the olfactory and tactile senses, while providing an even higher degree of realism.</p>

                      <br />

                      <h2> User Scenario</h2>
                      <p> Hsu, a teacher with two children in his late thirties, wants to get back in shape. As he is beginning to age, he is becoming more mentally drained because of the amount of work that is put on him. He is forgetting to input students grades into the grade book and forgets to assign daily assignments. In his efforts to get back in shape, Denrick purchased a fitbit that can help him track his personal health, but he is not familiar with the current technology. Once he downloads the app, it will prompt him to customize his personal profile. It will ask for his weight, height, age, and gender to best personalize his account. 
                            From here, the app gives a more in-depth tracking system that tracks your mental and physical state, how much water you have consumed, your weight, your meals, and your memory retention. 
                            Once finished with the activities, the application automatically calculates the evaluation and thus directs Denrick to his individualized score. The data is then displayed on a graph, so it will be easier for him to view his progress. After the span of a couple of weeks and multiple daily evaluations, Denrick sees a dramatic decline in his memory. The application automatically pops up a message that says,
                            "We have detected an unusual decline in your memory retention that requires attention. Please contact your medical provider to find out what steps to take next.” Denrick is prompted to see an actual doctor as the app detects that there is a potential he might have Alzheimer’s or a similar condition that affects his cognition. </p>

                      <p>Shaquita Liore, a receptionist at Allegren Pediatrics, is a fifty-year old obese woman who is divorced. She has a son, Jamie, who is nineteen and just starting college. She needs to pay for his tuition, but financial problems have been overwhelming. She has trouble processing the information told to her when she is inputting information
                       about the patients into the computer. She will occasionally forget the name she just typed in. She recently visited the doctor for her yearly visit and due to her weight, inactive lifestyle, and overall stress, the doctor determined she was fairly susceptible to Alzheimer’s disease. So, the doctor prescribed a fitbit to Shaquita and it was
                       paid for by her insurance. Shaquita has two goals: lose weight and increase her memory retention. After the memory activities have been finished, Shaquita is told that she is done for the day and the app synthesizes all of her data into graphs that display a trend. In a month, Shaquita and her doctor will be able to evaluate if her memory retention 
                       is getting worse or better and detect early signs of Alzheimer’s before its onset.</p>
